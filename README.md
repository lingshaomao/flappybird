    | 2	                        | 8%                    |
    | 3	                        | 6%                    |
    | 4	                        | 5%                    |
    | 5	                        | 4%                    |
    | 6~10	                    | Each player 2%        |

    * Example
        * Assume one round ticket income is 100000 TRX, then 100000x49%=49000 TRX will be Jackpot. NO.1 player can get prize 49000x12%=5880TRX, NO.2 player get 49000x8%=3920TRX, and so on.
4. Dividends：
    * When a round ends, the BOG token holders can get dividends. The total dividends are 49% of the bonus pool, it’s distributed according to each holders’ BOG amount.
    * Example
        * Assume one round ticket income is 100000 TRX, then 100000x49%=49000 TRX will be Dividends. Let’s say there are just 3 BOG holders, holder A has 100 BOG, holder B has 50 BOG, holder C has 150 BOG. 
        * Then A can get dividends: 49000x100/(100+50+150)=16333.33TRX, B can get: 49000x50/(100+50+150)=8166.67TRX, C can get: 49000x150/(100+50+150)=24500TRX.

## Future Plan
1. Add speed adjustment of Machine Learning mode, players can choose x2，x3，x5 to speed up training.
2. Add trained sample market, players can exchange samples.
3. Add ‘Pause’ function so player can take a rest.
4. Add ‘Revive’ function so player can continue playing from where he hit the pillar.
